-- Clean residential sales: normalise suburb/postcode, derive the sale date
-- (year + month) from the messy YYYYMMDD(.0) contract date, derive house/unit,
-- and drop non-market prices (see the two notes below). Staging is deliberately
-- kept wide and record-grain — it's the clean, verified mirror of raw.property_sales,
-- not a curated subset; only columns with unverified semantics (sale_interest,
-- sale_counter, prop_nature, component_cd, sale_cd, record_type) or that
-- duplicate something handled elsewhere (district_code) are left out.
--
-- property_type: per docs/property_data/profile_nswgov.py, a strata number means
-- the sale is a strata (unit-titled) property; no strata number means a house.
-- NOTE: COPY loads blank CSV cells as '' (not SQL NULL), so the check is on empty
-- string, not IS NULL — the pandas `.isnull()` equivalent for a text column here.
--
-- price floor: NSW sale records include non-arms-length transfers (family /
-- deceased-estate transfers recorded at nominal consideration) with no clean
-- price cliff separating them from genuine cheap sales — e.g. one postcode had
-- 17 same-year "sales" from $200 to $140,000. $10,000 is a conventional floor
-- for Australian property data; it won't catch every non-market row (the noise
-- is a continuum), but it keeps single nominal transfers out of the summary
-- marts. The marts no longer drop thin buckets, so they expose n_sold instead
-- for callers to weight/filter a median they don't fully trust.
--
-- sale_id: property_id alone isn't unique per row — split/fractional-interest
-- settlements share a property_id and contract date (see the price-floor note
-- above). They usually sell at different fractional prices, but not always
-- (e.g. an equal-share split can record the same price twice) — confirmed
-- against the sample data, where a naive hash of property_id/date/price
-- collided. row_number() over a fully deterministic order guarantees
-- uniqueness unconditionally instead: an arbitrary but stable-per-build
-- surrogate key, not a natural business key (same reasoning as stg_rent).
