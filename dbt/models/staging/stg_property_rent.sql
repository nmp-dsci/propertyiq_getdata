-- Clean rental bond lodgements: derive lodgement date (year + month), keep
-- positive weekly rents, and derive house/unit so rent can be compared
-- like-for-like with sales. raw.rentboard_lodgements only has 5 columns and all of them are
-- already used here — nothing else to widen (see stg_sales.sql for the
-- record of what was and wasn't brought in from raw.property_sales).
--
-- property_type: per docs/property_data/profile_rentboard.py, House + Townhouse
-- bonds are grouped as 'house'; Flat/Unit/Other as 'unit' (mirrors stg_sales so
-- the two datasets share a join key: property_type + month).
--
-- rent_id: raw.rentboard_lodgements carries no id-like column at all, and two genuinely
-- distinct bonds can legitimately share every other column (same postcode,
-- type, bedrooms, rent, lodgement date) — a hash of the natural columns could
-- wrongly collapse two real rows into one, so row_number() over a fully
-- deterministic order is used instead: an arbitrary but stable-per-build key,
-- not a natural business key.
